# Censo_PSF
Collecting data from 2007 to 2015 from censo and joinning 'Programa Saude da Familia' informations. This is my Term Paper, a study with kids with eleven years being impacted by the expansion of a health program of Federal government.

# Getting data
First, we downloaded the data from http://portal.inep.gov.br/microdados in a metadata format, unzip in a apropriate directory and build a script to load, filter and cleaning the data.

# Inserting the education variable
In a second moment, we add a education variable, that contains the years of study of every observation. We computed this variable from 'COD_ETAPA_ENSINO' that is a variable of educational level.
